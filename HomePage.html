                At SangamX, we’re a team of changemakers and disruptors from various backgrounds, such as finance, technology, the social sector, supply chain, and people management. 
Together, leveraging the collective experience of 150+ years of the founding team, we strive to reimagine and re-purpose the operating architecture of the social impact industry.
We are bringing together [“Sangam’] the orchestrators of societal impact globally, and significantly multiply [‘X’] their societal impact.

        <p>
            We believe that bringing rigorous thinking to the use of money and resources in (to) the world of social enterprises, will significantly multiply the impact being delivered.
        </p></div>
        <div class="col-sm box"><span>2</span>
        <p>
            We believe that incorporating the good of free-market mechanisms and creating a similar ecosystem appropriate for NPOs and Social Enterprises will multiply the delivered impact. We are calling this the Societal Markets.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm box"><span>3</span>
        <p>
            We believe that instilling a sense of competitiveness through a free-market mechanism continuously increase effectiveness of social impact organisations, thereby continuously increasing the social impact from resources.
        </p></div>
        <div class="col-sm box"><span>4</span>
        <p>
            We also believe that any re-design of these current industry structures needs to moderate adverse effects of capitalism from the get-go.
