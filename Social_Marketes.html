        <h4>Building societal markets
        </h4>
        <p>
            Our fundamental view is that a full-service free-markets mechanism, with the SSE as the vital backbone, is needed for this Societal Markets free markets mechanism to be a force multiplier for SEs as they have been for commercial businesses. Else, the SSE stands the risk of merely being a highly complex and costly sourcing alternative to SEs.</p>

                    <p>· SSEs are exchanges on which NPOs and FP-SEs (For Profit Enterprises focused on social impact), can list themselves and issue fund raising instruments such as bonds, equity etc.</p>
                    <p>· SSEs will aim at unlocking large pools of social capital (for NPOs), and encourage blended finance structures, so that conventional capital can partner with social capital to address the urgent challenges of society</p>
                    <p>· Listing and access to the SSE is linked to disclosure & audit requirements relating to financials, governance, operational performance and social impact</p>

                <h4>Now, building the core of societal markets</h4>
                <p>In a free market mechanism, the various balancing forces of the market participants are invoked, measured, aligned to achieve the best possible outcome for the investment, by a continuously moving “price”.</p>
                <p>This “price” is really an assessment (or valuation) of the organization’s ongoing ability to deliver on its stated objectives.</p>
                <p>The price is the pivotal measure that establishes a credible correlation between impact and investment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Without this ticking price, there is no Capital Markets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Without this ticking price, there will be no Societal Markets
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                   <P>
                        Ofcourse, we currently cannot create a ticking price for NPOs because the objective of the social impact sector is not (easily measurable) profit, but purpose. And so, we cannot replicate the valuation models that exists in the for-profit sectors to the social impact sectors.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        The core of the SangamX proposition is to create that core – an “Impact Ticker” that will enable all the market participants to continuously align to delivering societal impact at scale.

We are building a digital enablement platform that will enable NPOs/ SEs in particular to adapt and operate in this environment without adding materially to their overhead.
